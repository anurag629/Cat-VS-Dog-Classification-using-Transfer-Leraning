# Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a Deep Learninig Technique where we use a pre-trained model . 
This pre-trained model is trained for one task can be re-trained for a similar task with 
a smaller dataset.


Transfer Learning gives higher accuracy compared to training models from scratch.

## Examples of Pre-Trained Models: 
* VGG-16
* ResNet50
* Inceptionv3
* MobileNet V2

## Work Flow for this project:
1. Collect Data Set
2. Image Processing
3. Train / Test split
4. Pretrained MobileNet Model
5. MobileNet model trained on dog vs cat data
6. Process new image to classify Dag or Cat
