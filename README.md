# Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a Deep Learninig Technique where we use a pre-trained model . 
This pre-trained model is trained for one task can be re-trained for a similar task with 
a smaller dataset.


Transfer Learning gives higher accuracy compared to training models from scratch.

## Examples of Pre-Trained Models: 
* VGG-16
* ResNet50
* Inceptionv3
* MobileNet V2
